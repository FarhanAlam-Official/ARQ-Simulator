## üåü Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Visualize how ARQ protocols handle frame transmission and error recovery
- **Multiple Protocols**: Supports Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat ARQ
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust window size, error rate, simulation speed, and more
- **Step-by-Step Mode**: Walk through the simulation one step at a time for better understanding
- **Statistics**: Track performance metrics like efficiency, retransmissions, and frame losses
- **Export Data**: Save simulation results for further analysis
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üìö Educational Purpose

This simulator was designed as a teaching tool for computer networking courses, specifically for understanding:

- How ARQ protocols ensure reliable data transmission over unreliable channels
- The trade-offs between different ARQ protocols
- The impact of window size and error rate on transmission efficiency
- The mechanics of sliding window protocols

## üîç Supported Protocols

### Stop-and-Wait ARQ

The simplest ARQ protocol where the sender transmits a single frame and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next frame.

### Go-Back-N ARQ

A sliding window protocol that allows multiple frames to be in transit, but requires the sender to retransmit all frames from the point of error when a frame is lost.

### Selective Repeat ARQ

The most efficient ARQ protocol that allows multiple frames to be in transit and only retransmits specific frames that were lost or damaged.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- Pure JavaScript with no external dependencies
- CSS animations for visualizing frame transmission
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Event-driven simulation architecture

## üìã Usage Instructions

1. Select an ARQ protocol (Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, or Selective Repeat)
2. Adjust parameters like window size, error rate, and simulation speed
3. Click "Start" to begin the simulation or "Step" to advance one step at a time
4. Observe how frames are transmitted and acknowledged
5. View statistics to compare protocol efficiency
6. Export results for further analysis
